# Application Description and Features

## Overview
Phonix is an interactive pronunciation learning platform focused on phoneme-level mastery for English as a Second Language (ESL) learners.  
It addresses the lack of accessible tools that teach how to physically articulate individual sounds rather than only practicing words or sentences.  
The application enables users to understand, identify, and produce target phonemes accurately, improving long-term pronunciation skills.

## Key Features
1. **Interactive IPA Chart**
   - Visual, clickable chart of English phonemes.
   - Each phoneme provides articulation guides, example words, and audio playback.
   - Includes visual aids for place and manner of articulation.

2. **Phonemic Transcription Tool**
   - Converts user-input text into phonemic transcription.
   - Each phoneme in the transcription is clickable, linking to articulation details.
   - Handles common English pronunciation variants (e.g., General American focus initially).

3. **Articulation Guides**
   - Step-by-step instructions for producing each phoneme.
   - Visual diagrams of mouth and tongue positions.
   - Example recordings by native speakers.
   - Optional slow-motion or isolated sound playback.

4. **Minimal Pair Practice**
   - Interactive exercises contrasting similar phonemes.
   - Listening and speaking challenges to reinforce differences.

5. **Search & Filtering**
   - Search for phonemes by sound, spelling pattern, or articulation category.
   - Filter IPA chart by vowel/consonant, place of articulation, or voicing.

6. **Learning Path Support**
   - Suggested progression for mastering phonemes.
   - Recommendations based on user progress.

7. **Fallback Accuracy Layer**
   - If the system cannot confidently transcribe, a deterministic rule-based approach ensures a reasonable fallback result.

## User Interactions / Workflows
1. **Exploration Workflow**
   - User opens IPA chart.
   - Clicks on a phoneme to view articulation details and examples.
   - Listens to native pronunciation and attempts to mimic.

2. **Practice Workflow**
   - User enters a sentence into the transcription tool.
   - The tool generates phonemic transcription.
   - User clicks individual phonemes for targeted study.

3. **Contrast Training Workflow**
   - User selects or is assigned minimal pairs.
   - Practices listening and speaking to distinguish between similar phonemes.

4. **Self-Learning Path**
   - User starts with suggested beginner phonemes.
   - Completes articulation study and exercises.
   - Progressively moves toward more challenging sounds.
