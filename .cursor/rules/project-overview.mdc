Phonix is an interactive pronunciation learning platform focused on phoneme-level mastery for English as a Second Language (ESL) learners. It addresses the lack of accessible tools that teach how to physically articulate individual sounds rather than only practicing words or sentences, enabling users to understand, identify, and produce target phonemes accurately for improved long-term pronunciation skills.

# The Problem We're Solving

## Primary Problem: Lack of Phoneme-Level Articulation Instruction
Traditional pronunciation tools teach "repeat after me" without explaining how sounds are physically produced, leaving learners guessing at proper mouth, tongue, and lip positioning. This creates a foundational weakness where learners struggle with pronunciation because they don't understand the building blocks of English speech sounds.

## Secondary Problems
1. **IPA Intimidation**: The International Phonetic Alphabet seems complex and academic to many learners
2. **Limited Interactive Tools**: Most IPA resources are static charts without engaging, clickable exploration
3. **Disconnected Learning**: Phoneme instruction isn't connected to real word usage and examples
4. **Generic Feedback**: No personalized learning paths based on individual pronunciation difficulties

# Core Features & Learning Experience

## 1. Interactive IPA Chart
- **Visual, clickable chart** of English phonemes (General American focus initially)
- **Comprehensive phoneme details**: Each phoneme provides articulation guides, example words, and audio playback
- **Visual articulation aids**: Place and manner of articulation for consonants; height, backness, and rounding for vowels
- **Accessibility focus**: Mobile and desktop responsive with clear, learner-friendly interface

## 2. Phonemic Transcription Tool
- **Text-to-phonemes conversion**: User inputs words or phrases â†’ system outputs phonemic transcription
- **Clickable transcription**: Each phoneme in the transcription links to detailed articulation information
- **Dual approach**: Primary G2P model for accuracy with deterministic fallback for unknown words
- **Real-world application**: Helps learners understand pronunciation of new vocabulary

## 3. Articulation Guides
- **Step-by-step instructions** for producing each phoneme
- **Visual diagrams** of mouth and tongue positions
- **Native speaker recordings** with example words
- **Multi-modal learning**: Text, visual, and audio instruction combined

## 4. Interactive Practice Features
- **Minimal Pair Practice**: Interactive exercises contrasting similar phonemes with listening and speaking challenges
- **Listen & Identify**: Audio-based phoneme recognition with multiple choice responses and score tracking
- **Speech Input & Feedback**: Phoneme pronunciation checking with basic pass/fail feedback using speech recognition APIs
- **Word Repetition Mode**: Confidence-building exercises where users repeat words for recognition verification

## 5. Learning Path Support
- **Suggested progression** for mastering phonemes based on difficulty and common learner challenges
- **Personalized recommendations** based on user progress and identified pronunciation difficulties

# User Experience Philosophy

## Core Learning Flow
1. **Discover**: Users explore an interactive IPA chart where each phoneme is immediately accessible
2. **Learn**: Clicking reveals detailed articulation instructions, visual guides, and example words with audio
3. **Practice**: Text input provides phonemic transcription with each phoneme linking back to articulation details
4. **Progress**: Personalized practice based on identified pronunciation challenges and learning patterns

## Key Design Principles
- **Phoneme-first approach**: Everything starts with understanding individual sounds
- **Interactive discovery**: Learning through exploration rather than linear lessons
- **Immediate feedback**: Audio examples and visual guides available instantly
- **Real-world connection**: All phonemes connected to actual English words and usage
- **Approachable**: Makes IPA friendly and non-academic for everyday learners
- **Progressive enhancement**: Core functionality accessible to all, enhanced features for capable devices

# Technical Architecture Philosophy

## Modern Web Standards
- **Performance-first**: Instant IPA chart interaction, minimal loading times
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach for learners using phones and tablets

## Development Standards
- **Monorepo architecture**: Clear separation between web app, API, shared data, and utilities
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict settings
- **Component composition**: Reusable UI elements with compound component patterns
- **Data-driven UI**: Grid layouts generated from comprehensive phoneme data structures
- **Modern tooling**: Vite, React 19, TanStack Router, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui
