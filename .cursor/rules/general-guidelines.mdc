# General Guidelines

## General
- Check for relevant cursor rules when modifying the project. Examples:
  - when modifying UI components, check the UI guidelines.
  - when modifying the API routes, check the API guidelines.
- Check for relevant cursor rules
- Prefer using Context7 to look up the latest commands and documentation for the project.
- Prefer using pnpm as package manager.

## Code Style
- Do not include inline comments in code, unless the complexity makes it absolutely necessary.
- Use consistent naming conventions and coding styles: 
  - camelCase for variables and functions
  - PascalCase for classes, components and types
  - UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
  - kebab-case for filenames
- Prefer named exports over default exports.
- Prefer colocated file structure, keeping files close to where they are used instead of putting them all in big global folders.
  ```
  /app
   /dashboard
      page.tsx
      user-card.tsx
      stats-panel.tsx
      fetch-users.ts
  /components
    button.tsx
    modal.tsx
  /lib
    api-client.ts
    auth.ts
  ```

## TypeScript Guidelines
- Prefer the use of types instead of interfaces.
- Prefer type unions instead of extending interfaces.
- AVOID the use of `any`.

## DO NOT
- DO NOT READ .env or .env.local files, as they may contain sensitive info.
- DO NOT add new dependencies editing the package.json directly. Prefer the use of commands like `pnpm add <dependency_name>`.
- DO NOT add unnecessary JSDoc comments. Prefer using it only for complex and large functions, classes, components or interfaces.
- DO NOT run dev commands. Assume the user is already running them in a separate terminal.
