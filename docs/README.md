## Documents

- **[G2P Enhancement Implementation Plan](./g2p-enhancement-plan.md)** - Complete technical specification and implementation guide for improving the Grapheme-to-Phoneme system with homograph disambiguation and performance optimization.

## Quick Overview

The G2P Enhancement Plan outlines a three-phase approach to improve pronunciation accuracy and system performance:

1. **Phase 1: Foundation** - Optimize dictionary loading and support pronunciation variants
2. **Phase 2: Intelligence** - Add context-aware homograph disambiguation 
3. **Phase 3: Performance** - Implement hybrid architecture for optimal speed and bundle size

Each phase builds incrementally on the previous while maintaining full functionality and backward compatibility.
