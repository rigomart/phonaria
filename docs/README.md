# Phonix Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Phonix project.

## Documents

- **[Project Overview](./project-overview.md)** - High-level product, UX, and technical architecture overview, including the dictionary lookup feature and pronunciation audio.
- **[G2P Enhancement Implementation Plan](./g2p-enhancement-plan.md)** - Complete technical specification and implementation guide for improving the Grapheme-to-Phoneme system with homograph disambiguation and performance optimization.

## Quick Overview

The system focuses on phoneme-first learning with interactive charts, G2P transcription, and in-context dictionary lookup (with audio when available). The G2P Enhancement Plan outlines a three-phase approach to improve pronunciation accuracy and system performance:

1. **Phase 1: Foundation** - Optimize dictionary loading and support pronunciation variants
2. **Phase 2: Intelligence** - Add context-aware homograph disambiguation 
3. **Phase 3: Performance** - Implement hybrid architecture for optimal speed and bundle size

Each phase builds incrementally on the previous while maintaining full functionality and backward compatibility.
