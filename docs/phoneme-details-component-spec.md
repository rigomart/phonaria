# Phoneme Details Component – Requirements & Principles

## Purpose
- Establish a standalone, from-scratch specification for the Phoneme Details component.
- Ensure the surface communicates essential phoneme knowledge without relying on existing data structures, layouts, or hosting flows.
- Ground the redesign in learner-first, audio-centric principles that align with Phonaria’s goals.

## Functional Requirements
All sections are required unless their supporting content is unavailable. Long or secondary content must support progressive disclosure.

1. **Identity Snapshot**
   - Display the phoneme symbol, its phonetic category, and one learner-friendly description sentence.
2. **Sound Playback**
   - Provide a primary high-quality recording, a fixed-speed slow playback, and a loop control.
   - Ensure playback states supply clear feedback and accessible labels.
   - May include a small set of word-level clips tied to the phoneme.
3. **Production Guidance**
   - Describe articulation as a concise ordered sequence.
   - Reference static visual assets (e.g., sagittal diagram stills) aligned to each step.
   - Include at least one common mistake callout and one sensory cue to signal correct production.
4. **Spelling Bridges**
   - List high-frequency grapheme patterns that map to the phoneme and highlight notable exceptions.
   - Keep information compact; if content grows, allow learners to collapse or expand it.
5. **Variation & Context**
   - Document significant allophones or situational shifts with short explanations.
   - Indicate availability of alternate audio for each variation.
   - When more than a handful of variations exist, provide an explicit “show more” mechanism.
6. **Example Library**
   - Supply example words covering distinct positional contexts (initial, medial, final) when possible.
   - Each entry must include the orthographic form, an IPA fragment with stress marking as applicable, and audio playback.
   - Support (optionally) highlighting a source word that prompted the component, while keeping the component flow-agnostic.
7. **Contrast Preview**
   - Surface a small set of frequently confused phonemes, each with a distinguishing cue and optional sample pair snippet.
   - Provide a single handoff action for deeper contrast exploration (target URL configurable by the host).
   - Do not embed full contrast sessions inside the component.
8. **Tips & Practice**
   - Bundle actionable micro-prompts (self-checks, mnemonics, quick drills).
   - Ensure tips can be explored individually so they do not clutter the default view.

## Interaction & Accessibility
- All interactive controls (audio, toggles, expanders) must be keyboard accessible and provide immediate, perceivable feedback.
- Static visuals require descriptive text or captions.
- Tone should remain instructional, calm, and precise; define jargon through tooltips or inline explanations.

## Content & Asset Considerations
- Requires dedicated phoneme metadata covering identity, audio variants, production steps, grapheme mappings, variations, example word sets, contrast cues, and tip catalogues.
- Needs curated static imagery or iconography to support the production guidance section.
- Enforce concise copy to prevent cognitive overload; secondary data defaults to collapsed views.

## Risks & Notes
- **Information overload:** mitigated by strict word limits and progressive disclosure.
- **Content gaps:** demands enriched phoneme datasets and curated assets ahead of build.
- **Accessibility compliance:** ensure color contrast, labeling, and assistive tech support throughout.
