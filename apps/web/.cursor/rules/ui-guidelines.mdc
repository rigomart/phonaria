# UI Guidelines

- Use shadcn/ui components for building the user interface.
- Do not rely on what you think you know about shadcn/ui components, as they are frequently updated and improved. Your training data is outdated.
- Use Context7 to get the updated documentation for shadcn/ui installation, commands, and usage patterns.
- Always import from the local `@/components/ui/<component>` path.
- Follow accessibility and composition best practices.
- Prefer using variants (via `cva` or `tailwind-variants`) and cn utility for styling over conditional classes.
- Apply compound components patterns when building complex components.
  - Avoid prop drilling by using context for shared state
  - Keep component APIs clean and declarative
  ````tsx
  // Prop drilling - state threaded through multiple levels
  <Tabs activeTab={activeTab} onChange={setActiveTab}>
    <TabList activeTab={activeTab} onChange={setActiveTab}>
      <Tab isActive={activeTab === 0} onClick={() => setActiveTab(0)}>Tab 1</Tab>
      <Tab isActive={activeTab === 1} onClick={() => setActiveTab(1)}>Tab 2</Tab>
    </TabList>
  </Tabs>

  // Compound components - state managed internally
  <Tabs>
    <TabList>
      <Tab index={0}>Tab 1</Tab>
      <Tab index={1}>Tab 2</Tab>
    </TabList>
  </Tabs>
