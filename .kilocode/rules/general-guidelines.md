General instructions that you must absolutely follow.

## Guidelines

- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions, classes and types.
- Do not include inline comments in code, unless absolutely necessary.
- Use consistent naming conventions and coding styles: 
  - camelCase for variables and functions
  - PascalCase for classes, components and types
  - UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
  - kebab-case for filenames
- You can read .env.example files to know what environment variables exist in the project.
- DO NOT READ any other .env file apart from the specified previously as they may contain sensitive info.
- AVOID the use of `any`.
