# Context

## Current Work Focus

**Phase 1 MVP Implementation**: Currently implementing the Core MVP features as outlined in the brief. The project is in active development with a focus on phoneme-level learning through interactive IPA charts.

## Recent Changes

### Implemented Features
- **Interactive IPA Charts**: Complete consonant and vowel charts with clickable phonemes
- **Phoneme Dialog System**: Detailed phoneme information including articulation, examples, and audio
- **Data-Driven Architecture**: Comprehensive phoneme data structure with 40 phonemes (24 consonants, 16 vowels)
- **Audio Integration**: TTS generation system using ElevenLabs API for example word pronunciation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first UI with dark mode support using shadcn/ui components

### Technical Infrastructure
- Monorepo setup with pnpm workspaces
- React + TypeScript + TanStack Router architecture
- Tailwind CSS v4 with custom theme system
- Shared data package for phoneme information
- Component composition patterns for reusable UI elements

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Interactive Vowel Trapezoid**: Enhance vowel navigation with visual positioning
2. **G2P Transcription Tool**: Implement grapheme-to-phoneme conversion using LLM + Hono.js API
3. **Audio System Refinement**: Complete audio integration and fallback handling

### Upcoming Features (Phase 1 Completion)
- Basic phonemic transcription tool with clickable phonemes
- Enhanced articulation guides with visual diagrams
- Search and filtering capabilities for phoneme exploration

## Current State Assessment

**Status**: Core foundation is solid and ready for expansion
**Architecture**: Well-structured with clear separation of concerns
**Data Model**: Complete and extensible phoneme data structure
**UI/UX**: Modern, accessible, and user-friendly interface established
**Technical Debt**: Minimal, clean codebase with TypeScript safety
