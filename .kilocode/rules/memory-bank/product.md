## Why This Project Exists

Phonix addresses a significant gap in ESL (English as a Second Language) pronunciation learning tools. Most available resources focus on word-level or sentence-level pronunciation practice, but fail to teach the fundamental skill of how to physically articulate individual sounds (phonemes). This creates a foundational weakness where learners struggle with pronunciation because they don't understand the building blocks of English speech sounds.

## Problems It Solves

### Primary Problem
**Lack of phoneme-level articulation instruction**: Traditional pronunciation tools teach "repeat after me" without explaining how sounds are physically produced, leaving learners guessing at proper mouth, tongue, and lip positioning.

### Secondary Problems
1. **IPA intimidation**: The International Phonetic Alphabet seems complex and academic to many learners
2. **Limited interactive tools**: Most IPA resources are static charts without engaging, clickable exploration
3. **Disconnected learning**: Phoneme instruction isn't connected to real word usage and examples
4. **Generic feedback**: No personalized learning paths based on individual pronunciation difficulties

## How It Should Work

### Core User Experience Flow
1. **Discover**: Users explore an interactive IPA chart where each phoneme is clickable and immediately accessible
2. **Learn**: Clicking a phoneme reveals detailed articulation instructions, visual guides, and example words with audio
3. **Practice**: Users can input text to see phonemic transcription, with each transcribed phoneme linking back to articulation details
4. **Progress**: (Future phases) Personalized practice based on identified weak points

### Key Principles
- **Phoneme-first approach**: Everything starts with understanding individual sounds
- **Interactive discovery**: Learning through exploration rather than linear lessons
- **Immediate feedback**: Audio examples and visual guides available instantly
- **Real-world connection**: All phonemes connected to actual English words and usage
- **Accessibility**: Works on mobile and desktop with clear, learner-friendly interface

## User Experience Goals

### Primary Users: ESL Learners
- **Beginner**: Can explore IPA chart without intimidation, understand basic sound production
- **Intermediate**: Can use transcription tool to understand pronunciation of new words
- **Advanced**: Can identify specific phonemes causing pronunciation difficulties

### Secondary Users: ESL Teachers
- **Classroom integration**: Visual aid for phoneme instruction
- **Student progress**: (Future) Track class pronunciation improvement
- **Lesson planning**: Reference tool for articulation-focused lessons

### Experience Principles
1. **Approachable**: IPA made friendly and non-academic
2. **Interactive**: Every element clickable and explorable
3. **Immediate**: No waiting for audio or visual feedback
4. **Connected**: Phonemes always shown in context of real words
5. **Progressive**: Learning path from basic sound awareness to advanced articulation
6. **Accessible**: Works for users with varying technical literacy and device capabilities

### Success Metrics
- Users can identify and describe how to produce unfamiliar phonemes
- Learners successfully use transcription tool for new vocabulary
- Improved pronunciation accuracy in targeted phonemes
- Increased confidence in approaching unfamiliar English words
